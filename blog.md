# A List of Things To Do Besides Social Media
Tired of scrolling through your social media feed only to see the latest political rants, fake news articles, and pictures of new vacation photos from friends who are doing more with their lives than you are lately? 

Tired of committing to endless Facebook messenger correspondences with friends you'll likely never meet IRL or spending the entire day going back and forth with a complete stranger in the comment section of a friend's post with the goal of changing their world views?

Well, here is a list that I have compiled of positive things you can do other than **wasting your time** on social media. 

But first, check out this great browser app for Google Chrome that I use for times when I do need to be on the computer, but don't want to get distracted. It's called WasteNoTime and you can find it [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wastenotime/enebomhlllfaccbelnjhfgblnalofhch?hl=en) at the Chrome web store.

WasteNoTime has the capability to block out certain websites of your choosing while also letting you have the control over which days and times those sites will be blocked. 

Unfortunately, this app doesn't work for android or apple, but there are plenty of other apps that work just as good that you can find  at the [App Store](https://www.apple.com/ios/app-store/) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store?hl=en_US).

Now, here are some activities that have helped me stay productive as well as bring back a sense of meaning and purpose in my life. I hope it helps you too!
